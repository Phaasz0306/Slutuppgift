        <button class="q1">What is an NFT? ▼</button>
        <div class = "content1">
        <p>NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token. 
          NFTs are digital collectibles that live on the Blockchain.
          An NFT can represent real-world objects like art, music,
          in-game items and videos, and can hold utility like the perks mentioned above.
           Since these collectibles are non-fungible,
            which means that each of them is unique, it allows anyone to track and verify its ownership.<br>
             This is important for the project because it allows us to verify owners when giving out perks.</p>

      <div class = "Button-Hover2">
        <button class="q2">How do I purchase this NFT? ▼</button>
      <div class = "content2">
        <p>In order to purchase a Rasberry NFT, you will need to conduct two steps. First, you will need to purchase Ethereum (ETH) from a crypto-currency exchange such as Coinbase, Gemini, Binance, Kraken, etc. Once you have completed that step, you will need to transfer your ETH into a digital wallet capable of interacting with dApps, such as MetaMask. The wallet allows you to connect to the mint site and purchase/mint an NFT.</p>
      </div>

      </div>
    
      
      <div class = "Button-Hover3">
        <button class="q3">What is Gas? ▼</button>
      <div class = "content3">
        <p>Since each Ethereum transaction requires computational resources to execute, and each Rasberry NFT is stored on the Ethereum Blockchain, each purchase is coupled with a fee to compensate for the computational resources required to successfully conduct the transaction.</p>
      </div>

      </div>

      <div class = "Button-Hover4">
        <button class="q4">Is this the only chance? ▼</button>
      <div class = "content4">
        <p> No, after the NFT:s has been minted the owners can put them on sale on the NFT marketplace Opensea, therefore this will most likely not be the only chance of buying a Rasberry NFT. </p>
      </div>

      <div class = "Button-Hover5">
        <button class="q5">Why? ▼</button>
      <div class = "content5">
        <p> Owning an NFT means you have exclusive access to events such as Poker games.</p>
